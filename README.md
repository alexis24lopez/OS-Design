# OS-Design
Created a basic 16-bit OS using C++ as main language. It simulated a 16-bit CPU.

For more information about how the OS is designed, instruction set, run and write programs refer
to A 16-bit OS system specification a docx file.

Note: if you have installed c++, make, you can just compile makefile and then run the os.
