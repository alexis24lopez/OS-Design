The ouput of the OS Phase2 are located on the folder "OS Phase2 Output"
It includes all the files needed to run and compile and the files it
generates such as *.st, *.out, *.o. The *.out files contains the ouput
of the program *.s.

The OS when compile and run it generates *.st files, but when the OS
finished it empties the stack to the *.st files are empty. So I cannot
add empty files to GitHub. Its not shown on the OS Phase2 Output
but the OS generates it.
